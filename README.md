# Minimal-userchromeCSS
My attempt at creating a one liner interface for Firefox using the userChrome.css file. Very much a WIP.

# Installation
1. Download the files
2. Go to "about:support" in Firefox
3. Look for a line saying "Profile Folder" and open that folder
4. Copy the chrome folder into that folder
5. Go back to Firefox and go to "about:config"
6. type "userprof" into the search bar (the page's, not Firefox's)
7. If "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" shows up, change it from "false" to "true"
8. Restart Firefox

# Configuring
In the userChrome.css file, there are several global variables you can change. They are all explained inline.
